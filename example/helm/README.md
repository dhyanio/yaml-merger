## How Yaml-Merger helps in Helm charts

A YAML merger in Helm is helpful because Helm charts heavily rely on YAML files for configuration, and merging simplifies and streamlines the management of complex configurations. Hereâ€™s how it helps in the context of Helm:

1. Combine Values from Multiple Sources
Helm allows the use of multiple values.yaml files to override default chart configurations. A YAML merger ensures that:

Default values defined in values.yaml can be overridden with environment-specific configurations using custom files (e.g., production-values.yaml or staging-values.yaml).
Conflicts between these files are handled systematically, allowing overrides without overwriting unrelated keys.
